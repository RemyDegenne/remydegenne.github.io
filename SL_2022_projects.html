									<h3>Sequential learning projects</h3>
<p>
	The project consists in reading, understanding and explaining a research paper about a topic related to the class [you don’t need to understand all the proofs when there are some, but you do need to understand the results]. If possible, you are encouraged to implement the algorithm described yourself and report your own findings on close or different benchmarks than those presented in the paper.
</p>

<p>
What is expected? A short report (8 pages) explaining the topic in your own words (no copy-paste from the paper your study!), relating it to the course, discussing links with other algorithms you know, etc., reporting the findings of your own experiments,our opinion about the paper (possible weaknesses ?). 
In short any personal thoughts inspired by the paper.
</p>

<p>
You can team up for the project, groups of two students are welcome. 1 group / project maximum. 
</p>

<p>
Possible format: you may use the NeurIPS template if you are familiar with latex, but any other format is accepted. Using Overleaf allows you to write latex in a navigator with no installation on your computer, and the NeurIPS template is already there: 
<a href="https://fr.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx">https://fr.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Deadline: send your report to me by email by January 26nd, 2023 at 11:59pm. </b>
You can either submit a PDF file with your report or a zip file with your PDF report and source code to run your experiments (a github link in the report is also OK). In either case, the name of your submission should be SL22_Name1_Name2.pdf
</p>


<h3>List of possible projects</h3> 
You can also propose your own, please email me for approval with a short description of the project.

<h4>Bandits</h4>

<p>
<b>Bootstrapping and bandits</b>: researchers have developed alternatives to UCB or Thompson Sampling with an exploration that is more data-driven and directly uses the history of observed reward. This paper reveals that standard statistical bootstrap method cannot work, and propose a fix

</p>

<p>
<b>Bandits with delayed rewards</b>: In real-world problems, the reward is often observed after some random delay. This paper presents a way to cope with a known delay distribution:

</br>Project chosen by: Caroline Charreteur, Jean-Paul Duboux
</p>

<p>
<b>Non-stationary bandits</b>: Assuming the rewards are i.i.d. is often a big limitation in practice, and researchers have studied the so-called piecewise i.i.d. models, in which there can be some breakpoints in which the rewards distributions change abruptly. This paper proposes two ways to cope with non-stationarity, that you can understand and compare :

<b>Thompson Sampling for logistic bandits</b>: a logistic model is particularly well suited to model binary rewards and take features into account and could be useful for contextual recommendation. This paper discusses the implementation of Thompson Sampling in this setting:

<h4>Exploration in RL </h4>

<p>
<b>Posterior Sampling for RL</b>: the Thompson Sampling principle can be naturally extended to RL, provided one is able to maintain a posterior on the parameters of a Markov Decision Process. You can try to understand how it’s done here, and what theoretical guarantees the authors are able to give for this new exploration strategy.
