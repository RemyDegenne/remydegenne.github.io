The notion of stream-space used in other works like \cite{holzl2017markov} seems useful. This is $\Pi_n, \Omega_n$ with measurable space generated by the cylinders. This is the space used in the construction of the Ionescu-Tulcea probability. We could also simply define this measure as the default measure of $\Pi_n, \Omega_n$ without using a type synonym.
